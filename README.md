# Collection

This project has the sole purpose to have methods in a collection (list, array, set enumerable) with similar methods (or extension method).

It retrieves notions from `Javascript`, `Java`, `Kotlin`, `PHP` and `C#`.

_(Maybe other languages will be integrated, only the future will tell it)_

## Publication location
This project has only the Javascript / Typescript version uploaded.

But other languages will have different features based on how they can handle it.
